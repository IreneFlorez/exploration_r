# Introduction 

This project is a quick exploratory analysis project using R. 
The aim of the project is to use R to explore the relationships between 
data features.

We will be using a wine data set available at 
http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/.

'White Wine Quality' is a tidy dataset which contains 4,898 white wines
with 11 variables quantifying the chemical properties of each wine. 
At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing 
a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). 

We will use univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to explore
the relationships between the data features and to tease out the quality 
rating.  You can read the final summary and reflection at the end of the rmd doc.
